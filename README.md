# Repo-Navigation-Project1


Project 1: Navigation

##Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

Trained Agent

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

##Getting started

Download or clone the repository

Install the files in the Requirements

Run the Navigation.ipynb file to set up and train the agent

##Instructions

Open the Navigation.ipynb with Juyter Notebook and run each of the cells in the file. This will load the environment, set up the action value network, explore the environment and gradually learn until the average score is 13.
